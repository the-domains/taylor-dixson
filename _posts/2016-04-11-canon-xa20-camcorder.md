# Canon XA20 Camcorder

For live event coverage. Easy to use, XLR inputs with phantom power, full manual control when you want it. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ad1eec13-4eff-4da4-b453-9581ac75577a.jpg)

The lens goes a bit soft on the long end, the sensor is a tad noisy, 24Mbit .mp4 is kinda low. But I can hand this camera off to just about anyone and it produces acceptable footage.
